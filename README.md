## **Abstract**  
The **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)** virus, responsible for the **Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)**, has caused massive loss to life and property. With no definitive cure, the virus continues to mutate into more powerful variants within mere months. Modern drug development procedures typically take **5-10 years** to bring a new drug to the market, making rapid intervention challenging.  
 
**Drug Repurposing** is an approach that tests existing market-approved drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, enabling a **quick and safe line of treatment**. In this research, we propose a novel approach for drug repurposing using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with an Ensemble Learning Algorithm**.  
 
Additionally, we utilize the **molecular fingerprint** of repurposed drugs as a dataset to train a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**. The GAN functions as a differentiator to generate new **synthetic drug molecules** with similar or improved properties. These generated molecules can be synthesized and tested for further pharmaceutical applications.

## **I. Introduction**  
 
SARS-CoV-2 shares a close genetic relationship with **SARS-CoV-1**, yet **no specific drugs** have been developed to target it directly. The conventional drug development process requires **millions of dollars** and takes **5-10 years**, making it infeasible for an immediate solution.  
 
One effective strategy for viral treatment is the **inhibition of viral proteases** necessary for the proteolytic processing of polyproteins. This strategy has been successfully used for **HIV** and **Hepatitis C** treatments. Similarly, the **main protease (Mpro)** of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in viral replication, making it a **promising target for antiviral drug development**.  
 
### **Current Computational Drug Repurposing Approaches**  
1. **Molecular Docking**: Existing drug compounds are screened for their ability to bind with the **SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structure**.  
2. **Shape Screening & Docking Protocols**: Multiple docking simulations determine the molecular descriptors relevant to pharmacokinetics.  
3. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Stability of the docked molecules is evaluated, and ligand binding energies are quantified.  
4. **Off-Target Binding Evaluation**: Ensures that the proposed drugs are commercially viable.  
 
### **Our Approach**  
1. **Molecular Fingerprinting** of drug molecules using **SMILES representation**.
